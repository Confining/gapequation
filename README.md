# Gap equation

 There is gap equation in 2 dimensional QCD meson model, and it reads

$p \cos\big(\theta(p)\big) - m \sin\big(\theta(p)\big) = \frac{\lambda}{2} \int \frac{dk}{(p-k)^2} \sin\big(\theta(p)-\theta(k) \big)$

where $p$ is the momentum of quark, $m$ is the quark mass, and $\lambda$ is a unit parameter, which is usually chosen to be $\frac{1}{2}$.

 Li^1^ solved this equation by using a lattice method, and I wrote this mathematica file by employing the method as well.

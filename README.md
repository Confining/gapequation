# Gap equation

 There is gap equation in 2 dimensional QCD meson model, and it reads

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p%20%5Ccos%20%5B%5Ctheta%28p%29%5D%20-%20m%20%5Csin%5B%5Ctheta%28p%29%5D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Clambda%7D%7B2%7D%5Cint%20%5Cfrac%7Bdk%7D%7B%28p-k%29%5E2%7D%20%5Csin%5B%5Ctheta%28p%29-%5Ctheta%28k%29%5D)

where $p$ is the momentum of quark, $m$ is the quark mass, and $\lambda$ is a unit parameter, which is usually chosen to be $\frac{1}{2}$.

 Li^1^ solved this equation by using a lattice method, and I wrote this mathematica file by employing the method as well.
